        Being Geeky is one of the best platform for the online learning. With
        the best study material.Dummy text is text that is used in the
        publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which will
        later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for example,
        the final text is not yet available. Dummy text is also known as 'fill
        text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy texts as
        lyrics when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made' text to
        sing with the melody. Dummy texts have been in use by typesetters since
        the 16th century.

      <h2 class="display-5 py-3">All genuine Documentation at one place</h2>
      <p>
        Being Geeky helps the viewer to find all the required documentation at
        one place so that they need not waste time to find offical
        documentation. The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum',
        which is said to have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is
        composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to
        'proper' Latin. It contains a series of real Latin words. This ancient
        dummy text is also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most
        European languages in Latin script. The advantage of its Latin origin
        and the relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text does
        not attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from
        the layout.

        platform available.he spread of computers and layout programmes thus
        made dummy text better known. While in earlier times several lines of
        the Lorem Ipsum text were repeated in the creation of dummy texts, today
        the full text of Cicero's 'De finibus' serves as the basis for many
        dummy text or Lorem Ipsum generators. Based on 'De finibus', these
        generators automatically create longer sections of the Lorem Ipsum text
        or various other filler texts.

      <p>
        You can watch the lecture anytime from anywhere and ask doubts.The
        phrasal sequence of the Lorem Ipsum text is now so widespread and
        commonplace that many DTP programmes can generate dummy text using the
        starting sequence "Lorem ipsum". Fortunately, the phrase 'Lorem Ipsum'
        is now recognized by electronic pre-press systems and, when found, an
        alarm can be raised. This avoids a publication going to print with
        overlooked dummy text.

            You can apply different coupons to get extra discount on selected
            courses.Certain internet providers exploit the fact that fill text
            cannot be recognized by automatic search engines - meaningful
            information cannot be distinguished from meaningless:
            Target-generated dummy text mixed with a certain combination of
            search terms can lead to an increased frequency of visits by search
            machine users. As a consequence, advertising revenues, which rely on
            website 'hits', are increased.
